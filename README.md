# Landmine Detection bot
#the first three files have the code for Landmine detection Bot

The project implements bot control using keyboard signals transmitted over WiFi and received by Raspberry pi at the bot end

It aims to stream live video using a raspberry NoIR pi cam

This enables the user to wirelessly stream and control the bot at a very safe distance. 
It can reach difficult terrains and other remote areas difficult for humans access.
This can even work on a WiFi hotspot in remote areas devoid of proper connectivity
